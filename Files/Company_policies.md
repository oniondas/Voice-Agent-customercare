**Company Policy: Returns, Refunds, Cancellations & Delivery Timelines**

**Return & Refund Policies**

Clear and transparent return and refund procedures foster trust and help
customers shop with confidence. A well‑defined policy also protects the
business by setting expectations for timeframes, conditions and
processes. According to industry guidance, ecommerce stores commonly
allow returns within a finite window rather than indefinitely.

**Eligibility and Timeline**

-   **Return window:** Customers have up to **30 days** from the date of
    > delivery to request a return or exchange. Many ecommerce platforms
    > offer return windows ranging from 15 to 30 days, and some product
    > categories may have shorter windows of 7--10 days depending on the
    > nature of the goods.

    > **Condition:** Items must be unused, in their original packaging
    > and include all tags and proof of purchase. Products that are
    > personalized, perishable or marked as final sale are
    > **non‑returnable**.

    > **Exceptions:** For hygiene and safety reasons, certain personal
    > care products, consumables and digital downloads cannot be
    > returned.

**Process for Returns**

-   **Initiating a return:** Contact customer support with your order ID
    > and the reason for the return. Documentation such as photos may be
    > requested to confirm product condition.

    > **Authorization:** Once approved, you will receive a return
    > authorization and instructions on shipping the item back. Returns
    > sent without authorization may be refused.

    > **Shipping costs:** We cover return shipping for items received
    > damaged, defective or incorrect. For change‑of‑mind returns,
    > customers may be responsible for return shipping and any
    > restocking fees.

**Refunds and Exchanges**

-   **Modes of refund:** Refunds can be issued to the original payment
    > method, as store credit, or by exchanging the item for another
    > product.

    > **Processing time:** Once the returned item passes inspection,
    > refunds are processed within **7--10 business days**.

    > **Exchanges:** Exchanges are subject to stock availability. If the
    > requested replacement is unavailable, a refund or store credit
    > will be offered.

**Customer Responsibilities**

-   Customers are expected to use products as intended and not abuse the
    > return policy.

    > Items should be repacked securely to prevent damage in transit.
    > Including all original accessories and packaging helps expedite
    > the inspection process.

**Cancellation Rules**

Customers may cancel an order **before it has been shipped**. Major
online retailers allow cancellations prior to delivery but not after;
once delivered, the return policy applies.

-   **How to cancel:** Submit a cancellation request via customer
    > support or your account dashboard using your order ID as soon as
    > possible. If the order is still in processing, it will be
    > cancelled and a refund issued.

    > **Non‑cancellable items:** Customized products, gift cards and
    > clearance items are generally not eligible for cancellation. These
    > items will be clearly marked at the time of purchase.

    > **Refunds:** If payment has been captured, cancelled orders are
    > refunded to the original payment method within **7--10 business
    > days**. Store credit can be offered on request.

    > **After dispatch:** Once an order has been shipped, it cannot be
    > cancelled. Instead, customers may initiate a return through the
    > standard return process.

**Delivery Timelines**

Our goal is to deliver orders quickly and reliably while providing
flexible shipping options. Delivery times can vary depending on the
chosen shipping method and destination.
